# Configuring Internal Docker Hostname with Local Device

## Purpose

- Enables communication between Docker containers and local machine using custom hostnames
- Resolves DNS name resolution issues between Docker and host machine
- Facilitates development and testing of containerized applications

## How It Works

1. The /etc/hosts file serves as a local DNS lookup table
2. Adding entries maps hostnames to IP addresses locally
3. Docker containers can then resolve these hostnames to the host machine

## Key Benefits

- Simulates production environment locally
- Enables testing of domain-specific features
- Improves development workflow
- Avoids need for public DNS records

## Usage Notes

- Requires root/admin privileges to edit /etc/hosts
- Changes are immediate, no system restart needed
- Entries persist until manually removed
- Format: `127.0.0.1 your-hostname`

## Best Practices

- Keep backup of original hosts file
- Document any custom entries added
- Remove entries when no longer needed
- Use consistent naming conventions
